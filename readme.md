### [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **React Native** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **React Native** community styleguides & best practices.
